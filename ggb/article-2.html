								<span class="article-title">To choose the right needle for your procedure, you need to understand the key properties of needles</span>
								<p>A needle is defined by its diameter, the sharpness of the point, the texture of the point, the quantity of the needles in a grouping, and how the needles are grouped together.</p>
								<p>Every characteristic affects the imprint left on the skin and will affect your artistry and the final result.</p>
								<p>Please study your needles as carefully as you study your hand movements and your techniques. You may be surprised by how much of your artistry depends on correctly chosen needles.</p>
								<p>Let’s begin with understanding the PIXEL label.</p>
								<p>For example, let’s break down this label: 30 / 01 RL LT – T</p>
							</div>
							<div class="article-info-block">
								<span class="article-title">30/01 RL LT - T</span>
								<p><b>30</b> – Diameter of a single needle in a grouping</p>
								<p><b>01</b> – Quantity of needles in a grouping</p>
								<p><b>RL</b> – How needles are grouped together</p>
								<p><b>LT</b> – The length of the taper, i.e. the sharpness of the needle</p>
								<p><b>T</b> – Textured or smooth point surface</p>

							<span class="article-title">NEEDLE DIAMETER</span>
							<img src="img/article-13-min.jpg" alt="">
							<span class="article-title article-title-second">The needle diameter is the thickest point of the needle measured in millimeters</span>
							<p>It’s also referred to as size. PIXEL sizes go by <br>20 = 0.20mm, 25 = 0.25mm, 30 = 0.30mm, 35 = 0.35mm, and 40 = 0.40mm.</p>
							<p>The thicker the needle, the larger hole it makes on the skin. In turn, this causes more pigment to flow into the hole and remain in the skin. <br>Generally speaking, thicker and oilier skin requires a larger diameter needle (30, 35, 40). </p>
							<p>A thicker needle will give you more pigment flow, as well as offer greater stability. On the downside, a larger diameter needle creates more trauma to the skin.</p>
							<p>Mature, thin, dry skin takes up the pigment quickly and can be easily bruised and traumatized. Skin like this requires very gentle work, with low hand pressure and a thin needle diameter (20, 25).</p>
							<p>Smaller diameter needles will also be more flexible and giving, great for working with fine details and delicate skin.</p>
							<div class="article-block-info">
								<img src="img/article-14-min.jpg" alt="">
								<span class="article-title article-title-second">What happens if you choose the wrong needle diameter for your client’s skin?</span>
								<p>If you choose a very thin needle for thick, oily skin, you will overwork it by going over the same area many times while trying to implant enough pigment.</p>
								<p>Overworked skin will lose a lot of color during the healing process.</p>
								<p>On the other hand, if you choose a very thick needle for thin, delicate skin, you can over-traumatize the skin very quickly and the work will heal pixelated, showing each individual needle imprint.</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="article-block">
							<span class="article-title">TAPER</span>
							<img src="img/article-15-min.jpg" alt="">
							<span class="article-title article-title-second">The diameter of the needle is not the only thing you have to consider when choosing your needle</span>
							<p>The sharpness of the point also plays a big role in the size of the imprint left on the skin. Taper is the length of the tip of the sharp needle.</p>
							<p>PIXEL offers four tapers: short (2mm), medium (3.5mm), long (5mm) and ultra-long (7mm). The short taper is 2mm. It leaves a larger hole on the skin and allows for more pigment flow compared to the medium, long or ultra-long tapers.</p>
							<p>At the same time, the short taper is the most traumatizing of them.</p>
							<p>The medium taper will leave an average-sized hole on the skin, the long taper will leave a small hole, and the ultra-long taper will leave a very small hole.</p>
							<div class="article-block-info">
								<img src="img/article-16-min.jpg" alt="">
								<span class="article-title article-title-second">Why does taper size matter?</span>
								<p>The needle point is important because it determines the size of the imprint on the skin, how the ink flows from the needle and how much of the ink flows.</p>
								<p>The short point needle will have the most amount of ink flowing from the tip. It’s a better choice for using in a shading technique, especially if you need to quickly cover a large area. <br>The long and ultra-long points will give you more flexibility for creating detailed work, but won’t give you as much ink flow. The long point needles (LT, ULT) are great to use for hair strokes, the end of the eyeliner tail and any other fine work.</p>
								<p>You should also take into consideration the toughness of the skin. If the skin is very tough and hard to penetrate, you should choose to shade with a sharper needle.</p>

							<span class="article-title">TEXTURE</span>
							<img src="img/article-18-min.jpg" alt="">
							<span class="article-title article-title-second">Needles can be textured (rough surface) or polished (smooth surface)</span>
							<p>Textured needles can hold and deposit more color, but they tend to cause more trauma to the skin. Generally, you should choose textured needles for eyeshadows, hair strokes, or any type of work where you want to deposit the maximum amount of pigment in the minimal amount of passes.</p>
							<p>Do not go over the skin many times with texturized needles, or you will overwork the skin very quickly. Once you figured out the needle diameter and point, now you can think about how many needles you need to finish the job faster, with minimum trauma to the skin.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="article-block">
							<span class="article-title">QUANTITY OF NEEDLES IN A GROUPING</span>
							<img src="img/article-19-min.jpg" alt="">
							<span class="article-title article-title-second">PIXEL offers 1, 3, 5 and 7 needles in a grouping</span>
							<p>Imagine the needle as a paint brush. The larger the area you want to paint, the larger paint brush you will need. The larger paint brush delivers more pigment and will finish the job faster, but it isn’t very precise. Larger configurations are like large paint brushes. They deliver more pigment, but are harder to control. For great precision and fine detailed work, you need fewer needles in a grouping. Remember:</p>
							<p>Fewer needles in a configuration = more control over your work and less color deposit. <br>More needles in a configuration = more color deposit and less control over your work. <br>Single needles are very common nowadays. Some artists choose to work exclusively with single needles. Single needles and smaller needle configurations allow for a slower pigment built-up and greater attention to detail.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="article-block">
							<span class="article-title">NEEDLE CONFIGURATION</span>
							<img src="img/article-20-min.jpg" alt="">
							<span class="article-title article-title-second">PIXEL offers 3 needle configurations: <br>RL– Round Liner, <br>RS– Round Shader, <br>MG– Round Magnum</span>
							<p>A single needle is considered a Round Liner (RL). Round Liners have needles spaced close together, creating a dense color. They’re intended for line work and details. Depending on the technique used, the pattern can be crisp and solid.</p>
							<p>Round Shaders (RS) have needles spaced further apart, creating less dense color. They’re generally used for shading and filling. Depending on the technique used, the pattern can be diffused and airbrushed.</p>
							<p><br><br><span>Pro tip: If you compare the imprint of the liner to a looser shader, you will see a comparatively denser pigment saturation. A shader imprint will have softer, more dispersed color.</span></p>
							<div class="article-block-info">
								<img src="img/article-21-min.jpg" alt="">
								<p>Round Magnums (MG) are meant for shading over a large area in a timely manner, creating a diffused airbrushed look. Larger needle configurations require more pressure and more 3-way skin stretch than smaller needle configurations. Use a slower speed of the power supply to prevent large configurations from overworking the skin.</p>
								<img src="img/article-22-min.jpg" alt="">
								<p>In general, Round Magnums will give a softer airbrushed look compared to Round Liners and Shaders. The round grouping will give you a more pixelated look and texture, which can be useful in areas where no hair grows. Magnums are great for a full coverage lipstick effect and to create a powdery shadow for the eyebrows.</p>

					<p>Needle hang is how far the needle is extended from the cartridge when the machine is working.</p>
					<p>Needle hang affects the pigment flow. If it is too long, it will not bring out any pigment as the needle retracts. The pigment should have an even, consistent flow. If you see too much pigment flowing or not enough, you need to adjust the needle hang.</p>

					<span class="info-title">Speed</span>
					<p>Machine speed (the number on the power supply) and hand speed will determine the density of pigment on the skin:</p>
					<p>Machine speed determines how many times the needle pattern touches the skin.</p>
					<p>Hand speed determines the distance of the needle patterns or dots on the skin.</p>
					<p>Generally, you will deliver more pigment, creating a more solid look with a higher speed needle. If you want to create an airy look while using a fast speed, you should use a higher speed hand movement.</p>

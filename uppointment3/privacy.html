				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>Uppointment takes the importance of your personal information very seriously, and we are committed to its protection. To do that, we have established procedures to ensure that your personal and sensitive information is handled responsibly and in accordance with relevant data protection and privacy laws. All Uppointment data are stored in secure and reliable cloud servers. The Uppointment Privacy Policy describes what information we collect when you visit the network, how we use that information, and how you can control that information.</p>
				<h2>How Information is Collected</h2>
				<p>Information we obtain from your use of our website is primarily non-personal information similar to that which servers, web browsers, and services like Google Analytics typically make available. Other non-personal information that we might have access to includes how you use the API (for example: particular fields requested for your website), cookies, your approximate location, etc.</p>
				<p>We collect this non-personally identifiable information to better understand how customers use the service, visitors use the website, and improve user-experience. For example, we may monitor the most common content on the network to help identify spam or abuse. In some cases, we may publicly display information that is not personally identifiable, (for example: by posting a report on the most popular API requests, such as Services, Buffer Times, Prices and so on) or may provide this information to third parties for educational or similar purposes other than for any sort of profit.</p>
				<p>Occasionally, Uppointment might use this information to publicly display usage statistics. We may also collect your IP address when you use Uppointment for the purpose of understanding the needs of our users.</p>
				<h2>What Information is Collected</h2>
				<p>Account Content - We use your account information to identify you as a business or individual. Your name, business name, email and website addresses, and API usage.</p>
				<p>Information voluntarily posted in publicly visible parts of Uppointment is considered to be public, even if it would otherwise be considered as personally identifiable or sensitive. As such, it is not subject to the protocols listed below. This is because we do not control such postings; you do. Additionally, voluntarily publicizing such information means that you lose any privacy rights you might normally have with regards to that information. This also increases your chances of receiving unwanted communications such as spam.</p>
				<p>Uppointment will not provide your sensitive account information – including passwords, email addresses, financial information or names – to any third party. We value your privacy, but we are not responsible if you choose to share your sensitive information with anyone or any third party.</p>
				<p>In addition to your activity inside Uppointment, we collect information about web browsers, and servers, as well as information that services like Google Analytics typically make available, such as browser type, referral site, and duration of each site visit.</p>
				<p>We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 16. If you believe that a child has provided us with personally identifiable information without the consent of his or her parent or guardian, please notify us via the contact form so we can investigate and take the necessary steps.</p>
				<h2>Cookies and GDPR Regulation</h2>
				<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer and is provided to the website by the visitor’s browser each time the visitor returns. Uppointment uses cookies to help track visitor preferences and use of the network. If you use Uppointment and do not want cookies to be stored on your computer, it is your responsibility to adjust your browser settings to turn off cookies. You should be aware that certain features of Uppointment may not function properly without cookies enabled on your device.</p>
				<p>Third party vendors, such as Google Ads, use cookies to serve ads based on a user’s prior visits. Use of the DoubleClick cookie enables Google and its partners to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and/or other sites on the internet. You may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting Ad Settings.</p>
				<p>Note that Uppointment uses third party servers, software, and other products. Although Uppointmentis not affiliated with these parties, you automatically agree to their terms and conditions when you use Uppointment products.</p>
				<p>If you are located outside the United States, be aware that any personally identifiable information you enter into our systems will be transferred out of your country and into the United States (and possibly other countries). By using Uppointment, you consent to this transfer, and you are indicating that you have the right to transfer such information outside of your country.</p>
				<p>Uppointment acts in accordance to the GDPR Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) published at eur-lex.europa.eu</p>
				<h2>Use of Collected Information</h2>
				<p>If you are a registered user with Uppointment and have provided us with your email address, we may occasionally send you an email to let you know about new features, solicit feedback, and keep you up to date on the latest news on Uppointment. Note that if we do send you information that you did not specifically request, we will provide you with the chance to voluntarily opt out of this service.</p>
				<p><span>Security</span> - Uppointment accepts credit cards, PayPal and Apple Pay as payment methods. Uppointment does not store any credit card or financial information. All private financial and credit card information is stored securely by your financial merchant, and you are subject to their terms and conditions and privacy policy.</p>
				<p><span>Accuracy of Data</span> - In addition to protecting your personal information, we also work to keep data up to date to the best of our ability. Note that we are not responsible for inaccurate data submitted by our users. We are also not responsible for any loss of data.</p>
				<p><span>Access</span> - Upon request, we will provide you with reasonable access to the personal information we collect about you. You will have the opportunity to correct, update, modify, or delete the information by contacting us via ticket, chat or email when available. Note that we may limit an individual’s access to personal information where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy or where doing so would violate the rights of others.</p>
				<p><span>Enforcement</span> - We will conduct internal audits of our compliance with this privacy policy. Uppointment administrators take your privacy seriously, and we will take all reasonable measures against anyone found to be in violation of this policy.</p>
				<h2>Information We Will Never Ask For or Collect</h2>
				<p>We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information, such as social security numbers, financial information including credit card, PayPal and Apple Pay information, genetic data, health information, or religious affiliation information. Although we do not intentionally collect this sensitive personal information, we realize that you might store this kind of information somewhere in your account. If you store any sensitive personal information on the Uppointment servers, you are consenting to our storage of that information on our servers, which are located in the U.S., and we are not responsible for that information.</p>
				<h2>Unanswered Privacy Concerns</h2>
				<p>If you have other questions about privacy, or anything else contained in the Uppointment Privacy Policy, please contact us via ticket, chat or email.</p>

      </div>
     		<div class="terms-content">
	        <p>Welcome to our Privacy Policy Your privacy is critically important to us.</p>

					<p>Lendvent is located at:<br>
					NEW YORK OFFICE<br>
					9 Park Place, 1st Floor<br>
					Great Neck Plaza, NY 11021</p>

					<p>Lendvent's policy is to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our Website. This Privacy Policy applies to https://www.lendvent.com/ (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://www.lendvent.com/"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information we may collect on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information from other sources.</p>

					<h3>Website Visitors</h3>

					<p>Like most website operators, Lendvent collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Lendvent's purpose in collecting information is to understand better how Lendvent's visitors use its Website. From time to time, Lendvent may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in its website usage.</p>

					<p>Lendvent also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged-in users and users leaving comments on https://www.getflatiron.com/ blog posts. Lendvent only discloses your logged-in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

					<h3>Personally-Identifying Information</h3>

					<p>Certain visitors to Lendvent's websites choose to interact with Lendvent in ways that require Lendvent to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Lendvent gathers depend on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog at https://www.getflatiron.com/ to provide a username and email address.</p>

					<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

					<h3>Advertisements</h3>

					<p>Ads appearing on our Website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Lendvent and does not cover cookies by any advertisers.</p>

					<h3>Links To External Sites</h3>

					<p>Our Service may contain links to external sites that we do not operate. If you click on a third-party link, the link will direct you to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy and terms and conditions of every site you visit.</p>

					<p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites, products, or services.</p>

					<p>https://www.lendvent.com/ may use Google AdWords for remarketing<br>
					https://www.getflatiron.com/ uses remarketing services to advertise on third-party websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven't completed a task on our site, for example using the contact form to enquire. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google search results page or a website in the Google Display Network. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits. Of course, we will use any data collected following our privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.</p>

					<p>You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Preferences page. You can opt-out of interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently using a browser plugin.- Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information Lendvent discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information to process it on Lendvent's behalf or to provide services available at Lendvent's Website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Lendvent's Website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, Lendvent discloses potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Lendvent believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Lendvent, third parties or the public at large. Lendvent will not rent or sell potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information to anyone.</p>

					<p>Suppose you are a registered user of https://www.getflatiron.com/ and have supplied your email address. In that case, Lendvent may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or keep you up to date with what's going on with Lendvent and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example, via a support email or one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it to help us clarify or respond to your request or help us support other users. Lendvent takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally identifying information.</p>

					<h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>

					<p>Lendvent may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its Website. Lendvent may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Lendvent does not disclose your personally identifying information.- Affiliate Disclosure This site uses affiliate links and does earn a commission from certain links. This does not affect your purchases or the price you may pay.- Cookies To enrich and perfect your online experience, Lendvent uses "Cookies", similar technologies and services provided by others to display personalized content, appropriate advertising, and store your preferences on your computer.</p>

					<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer and that the visitor's browser provides to the Website each time the visitor returns. Lendvent uses cookies to help Lendvent identify and track visitors, their usage of https://www.lendvent.com/, and their Website access preferences. Lendvent visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Lendvent's websites. The drawback is that certain features of Lendvent's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

					<p>By navigating our Website without changing your cookie settings, you acknowledge and agree to Lendvent's use of cookies.</p>

					<p>Those who engage in transactions with Lendvent – by purchasing services or products, are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Lendvent collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Lendvent. Lendvent does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

					<h3>Business Transfers</h3>

					<p>If Lendvent, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Lendvent goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer of Lendvent may continue to use your personal information as outlined in this policy.</p>

					<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>

					<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Lendvent may change its Privacy Policy from time to time and at Lendvent's sole discretion. Lendvent encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>

					<h3>Contact Information</h3>

					<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us via contact@lendvent.com or phone.</p>
